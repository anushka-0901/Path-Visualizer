# Path-Visualizer
Path Visualizer built with React.js that helps in visualizing various pathfinding algorithms. It provides an interactive platform to find the shortest path between two points on a grid using popular algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).

Features
- Interactive Grid: Easily create walls, start, and end points on a grid.
- Multiple Algorithms: Visualize different pathfinding algorithms and understand their behavior.
- Step-by-Step Visualization: Watch the algorithm in action as it explores the grid.
- Real-Time Updates: See the shortest path and exploration process in real-time.
Algorithms Implemented
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Handles graphs with negative weight edges and finds the shortest path from the start node.
- A* (A-Star) Algorithm: Uses heuristics to find the shortest path faster by prioritizing paths that are likely to lead to the goal.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
